# Traceroute (Golang)

This is an implementation of UDP (quic support) and TCP Traceroute in golang. 
It is specifically tailored to my use case for measurements and can be seen as an example for implementation.

*NOTE* This is an experimental fork to have network distributed traceroutes emit otel traces.
